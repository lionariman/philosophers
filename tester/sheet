parent process | child process
v,u            | x,y

a = a + 5 (in child (x))
a = a - 5 (in parent (u))

therefore x = u + 10

step by step - example:

parent process starts and child process starts in parent process.
a = 2.
a = a + 5,
x = a = 7.

child process stops and parent process continued.
a = 2.
a = a - 5,
u = a = -3.

then:
x = u + 10.
a + 5 = a - 5 + 10.
